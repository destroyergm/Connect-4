# Connect 4 - game in Ruby
This is my solution for the exersise "Connect 4" from the website [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/).
# Instructions
In order to run the game just run the command `ruby start.rb`
In order to see my specs with RSPec just run the command `rake` ( Keep in mind that you need RSpec and Rake installed in order to see this )
# About
This was programmed in Ruby with RSpec, using TDD(Test Driven Development) standards.
